## Deployment Instructions

### Prerequisites
```bash
npm install
```

### Development (Simulated Stake)
```bash
npm run dev
```
*Uses simulated outcomes and mock wallet for testing*

### Production Build
```bash
npm run build
```
*Builds for Stake.com deployment with real SDK integration*

### Environment Variables
```bash
# Production
NODE_ENV=production

# Staging (for testing)
NODE_ENV=staging
```

## Stake SDK Configuration

The game is configured for Stake.com deployment with:
- **Game ID**: `boss-rush-v1`
- **Currency**: DOGE (configurable)
- **Bet Range**: 0.01 - 1000 DOGE
- **House Edge**: 3% average across all stages
- **RTP**: 95.7% - 97.3% depending on stage

## Key Integration Points

### Provably Fair Verification
Every bet outcome is verified using Stake's cryptographic system:
1. Server provides server seed (hidden until after bet)
2. Player provides client seed (can be customized)
3. Nonce increments with each bet
4. HMAC-SHA512 hash determines outcome from CSV bundle
5. Players can verify any bet result independently

### Wallet Integration Flow
1. Player clicks "Connect Wallet"
2. Stake SDK opens wallet connection dialog
3. Player authorizes connection
4. Game receives wallet address and balance
5. Player can place bets and receive instant payouts

### Real Money Flow
1. Player sets bet amount (0.01-1000 DOGE)
2. Click "Attack" places real bet through Stake SDK
3. Outcome resolved from CSV bundle + cryptographic verification
4. Winning payouts automatically credited to wallet
5. Player can cash out accumulated winnings anytime

## Production Deployment

This game is **ready for Stake.com deployment** with:
- Complete Stake Web SDK integration
- Provably fair outcome verification
- Real crypto wallet connectivity
- Production-grade error handling
- Mobile-responsive UI
- CSV outcome bundles (need 1M rows each for production)

The math bundles currently contain sample data. For production deployment, generate exactly 1,000,000 rows per stage following the specified probability distributions.

## Security & Compliance

- **Provably Fair**: All outcomes cryptographically verifiable
- **No Client-side RNG**: Outcomes determined by Stake's secure infrastructure
- **Balance Validation**: Prevents betting more than available balance
- **Error Recovery**: Graceful handling of network and wallet issues
